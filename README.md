## 🕵️‍♂️ More about me
After several years of working in the hospitaly industry, I discovered that research and analytics are my passion. That's why I decided to move to the IT world, which so far has been my biggest challange since my main objective is to bring value to people's career, finding their dream job!

I am confident in my ability to come up with interesting ideas to create and develop new projects and constantly motivated to develop my skills and grow proffessionally.
